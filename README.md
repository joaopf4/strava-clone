# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The project
This project was made as a self challenge of clonning Strava aplication, once I'd never seen any tutorial or imersions on web teaching to clone Strava. 
I've seen many clonings of spotfy, netflix, twitter, but never seen an strava clone, rs. 

So here's the first try on internet xD.


## To run it

Clone rep to your local. 

Once you did, on project directory firstly run 
### `npm install` or `yarn install`

So then on the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
